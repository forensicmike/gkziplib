# gkziplib

GKZipLib was written for fast parsing of ZIP archives generated by GrayKey in .NET. Programmatically speaking, both native & third party publically available libraries were either too slow at parsing large ZIPs or failed when attempting to parse GK zips (or both).

This library parses only what it needs to get by on each entry. It parses the entire central directory into RAM which facilitates extremely rapid parsing of the CD. Then, on a file-by-file basis, you can decide whether or not to load additional details such as the data's absolute offset within the file, the file's compressed/uncompressed size, and so on.

Please see Example.cs for the simplest usage - using a foreach statement to iterate the entries in the ZIP.
